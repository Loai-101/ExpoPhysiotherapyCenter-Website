# FormSubmit Setup - Direct Email Sending

## What is FormSubmit?
FormSubmit is a service that allows you to send form data directly to your email without any backend server. It's the same service used by the dental website you referenced.

## How It Works
1. User fills out the appointment form
2. Form data is sent directly to FormSubmit
3. FormSubmit sends a formatted email to `q9g8moh@gmail.com`
4. No email client windows open - everything happens in the background

## Current Configuration
- **Email Address**: `q9g8moh@gmail.com`
- **Service**: FormSubmit (https://formsubmit.co/)
- **Template**: Table format for easy reading
- **Subject**: "New Appointment Request - Expo Physiotherapy Center"

## Email Format
When someone submits the form, you'll receive an email like this:

```
Subject: New Appointment Request - Expo Physiotherapy Center

Someone just submitted your form on [your-website-url].

Here's what they had to say:

name: John Doe
email: john@example.com
phone: +97312345678
appointment_date: 2025-01-15
appointment_time: 2:00 PM
service: Manual Therapy
urgency_level: Normal (Within 1 week)
message: I have back pain and need treatment
language: English
```
